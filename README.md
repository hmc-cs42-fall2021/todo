# Example React application

This is a sample web application, built with [React](https://reactjs.org/). Here
is a [running demo](https://hmc-cs42-fall2021.github.io/todo).

To run this example, you will need the
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) JavaScript runtime and
the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) package manager.

## Setup

First, download the code. In the folder that contains the code,
run the command `yarn install`, to install all the JavaScript library
dependencies. This step may take awhile, but you should need to do it only once.

## Running

To run the code, run the command `yarn start`. This command should open a
browser tab with the application.
